# Enhancing Patient Selection in Clinical Trials for Sepsis Through an Artificial Intelligence-driven Enrichment Strategy

This interpretable AI-based model using clinical data accurately identify patients with different disease courses, which can reduce the heterogeneity of septic patients in future clinical trials. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty of the model outputs, and enable the performance of the model using a mixed confidence approach. Application of this model can identify more homogeneous patient populations and precision pharmacological treatments for sepsis trials.
